**Project: Twitter Sentiments Analysis**

**Overview:**
The Twitter Sentiments Analysis project aims to analyze and determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of tweets posted on Twitter using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The project leverages the NLTK library for tokenization, cleaning, and classification of tweets to gain insights into public sentiment on various topics.

**Features:**
1. **Sentiment Analysis Script:**
   - The core of the project is a sentiment analysis script that processes tweets and classifies them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - Tweets are tokenized into words and preprocessed by removing stopwords and punctuation to focus on meaningful content.

3. **NLTK Library Integration:**
   - The project utilizes the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), a powerful library for NLP tasks, to handle tokenization, stopwords, and other linguistic processing.

4. **Machine Learning (Naive Bayes Classifier):**
   - The sentiment analysis script employs a Naive Bayes classifier trained on a dataset of positive and negative tweets. This allows the model to learn patterns and make predictions on new tweets.

5. **Twitter API Interaction:**
   - The project includes functionality to interact with the Twitter API. Users can provide a Twitter username or hashtag for analysis.

6. **Web Visualization:**
   - The project provides a web visualization component, enabling users to see sentiment analysis results in a user-friendly manner.

7. **Dockerized for Containerization:**
   - The project is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and run in various environments.

**How to Use:**
1. **Installation:**
   - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Krishancse/twitter-sentiments-analysis.git`
   - Navigate to the project directory: `cd twitter-sentiments-analysis`
   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **Configure API Keys:**
   - Obtain Twitter API keys and fill in the necessary information in the `config.py` file.

3. **Run Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Execute the sentiment analysis script: `python analyze_sentiments.py`
   - Input: Provide the Twitter username or hashtag when prompted.
   - Output: View the sentiment analysis results for the specified Twitter user or hashtag.

4. **Web Visualization (Optional):**
   - Explore sentiment analysis results through the web visualization component.

**Testing and Continuous Integration:**
The project includes a testing framework using `unittest` to ensure the correctness of the sentiment analysis script. Additionally, a GitHub Actions workflow is set up for continuous integration, automatically running tests and checks on every push to the main branch.

**Future Enhancements:**
- Explore deep learning models for sentiment analysis to potentially improve accuracy.
- Extend web visualization features for a more interactive user experience.
- Implement more advanced natural language processing techniques.
